# JavaScript Clock

This is a basic clock application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This project was created as a learning exercise to improve my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, particularly working with Date objects and manipulating the DOM.

## Features

- Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates every second to reflect the current time.

## Lessons Learned

Building this clock was a valuable learning experience. Here are some of the key lessons I learned:

- **Working with Date objects:** I gained a better understanding of how to work with JavaScript's Date object to get and display the current time.
  
- **DOM manipulation:** I practiced updating the DOM dynamically using JavaScript to reflect the changing time.
  
- **Handling challenges:** One of the challenges I faced was formatting the clock for mobile devices. Despite my efforts, I wasn't successful in making it fully responsive this time.

## Future Improvements

While I wasn't able to fully format the clock for phones in this iteration, I will continue to work on it to improve its responsiveness and make it more accessible on mobile devices. Here are some improvements I plan to implement:

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the clock works well on phones and tablets.
  
- Enhance the user interface to make the clock more visually appealing and easier to read.

## Usage

To use the clock, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
